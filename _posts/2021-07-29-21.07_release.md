On behalf of the SPDK community I'm pleased to announce the release of [SPDK 21.07](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v21.07)!!

This release contains the following new features:

- **Kernel DSA:** Added support in IDXD library for the kernel DSA driver.
- **Init library:** Added Init library that initializes the SPDK subsystems.
- **Userspace DTrace:** Added support running bpftrace scripts against SPDK applications. See [USDT](https://spdk.io/doc/usdt.html).
- **zipf utility:** Added zipf random number generator with power law probability distribution. When used with bdevperf and nvme perf tools - blocks over the full range of LBAs will be used, but will more frequently select lower-numbered LBAs.
