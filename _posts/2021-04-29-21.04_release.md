On behalf of the SPDK community I'm pleased to announce the release of [SPDK 21.04](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v21.04)!!

This release contains the following new features:

- **ZNS NVMe bdev:** Added support for zoned namespaces to the NVMe bdev module. This builds on the work to support zoned namespaces in the NVMe driver in the previous release.
- **NVMe PMR:** Added support for the Persistent Memory Region feature to NVMe driver.
- **NVMe-oF ADQ:** Added support for Application Device Queues (ADQ) to the NVMe-oF TCP initiator.
- **RPM:** Added script for building SPDK RPM packages. See [RPM documentation](https://spdk.io/doc/rpms.html).

Users updating from the previous release should note that a large number of deprecated APIs have been removed. The process for deprecation has been formalized in [deprecated.md](https://spdk.io/doc/deprecation.html), where a list of deprecation notices for future releases can be found.

The full changelog for this release is available [here](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v21.04).
