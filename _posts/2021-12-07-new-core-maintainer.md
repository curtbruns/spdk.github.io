The SPDK project has a team of core maintainers who are responsible for providing
technical oversight for the SPDK project, including final review and merging of
patches into the SPDK code base. As the SPDK project continues to grow, the core
maintainer team also needs to grow by adding contributors who are already
demonstrating technical skill and leadership within the project. So we are
pleased to announce that we are adding Konrad Sztyber to the core maintainer team!

Konrad has been a key contributor to SPDK with a special focus on the NVMe driver,
tracing infrastructure, Intel VMD driver and FTL.  Konrad is also a key reviewer
across a variety of SPDK libraries and components.  Konrad is from Intel and
is based in Gdansk, Poland.

Thanks,

Jim Harris (representing the core maintainer team)
