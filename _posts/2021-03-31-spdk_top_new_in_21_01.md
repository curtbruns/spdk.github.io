In SPDK's [21.01](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/releases/tag/v21.01) release `spdk_top` received a few improvements that we're excited to share.

## Improvements

First, the menu at the bottom has been extended with several new options:

The pollers tab also has a new column showing whether each poller is considered idle or busy.

## New Features

Now `spdk_top` allows rows to be highlighted using the arrow keys. Pressing `Enter` will pop-up additional details about the selection.

Here's what it looks to highlight and select a row in the threads tab:

And here's what it looks like on the pollers tab:

Finally, the cores tab:

![Cores pop-up details window](../../../../../img/blog/spdk_top/spdk_top_cores_pop_up.png)

The pop-up on the cores tab is unique because it has its own nested selection and highlighting. This is convenient to quickly select a thread for statistics without switching over to the threads tab. When selecting a thread from this pop-up menu and pressing `Enter`, the same pop-up from the threads tab will be displayed.

There are now two viewing modes in `spdk_top`.

* Data collected since the start of the application
* Data collected since the last refresh

We believe `spdk_top` is an excellent tool for viewing the real time performance characteristics of SPDK applications, but it can always be better. Please contribute either [code](https://spdk.io/development) or [ideas](https://github.com/spdk/spdk/issues)!
