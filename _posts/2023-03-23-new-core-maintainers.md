title:  "New Core Maintainers For SPDK CSI"
author: Ben Walker
categories: news

The SPDK project has a team of core maintainers who are responsible for providing
technical oversight for the SPDK project, including final review and merging of
patches into the SPDK code base. As the SPDK project continues to grow, the core
maintainer team also needs to grow by adding contributors who are already
demonstrating technical skill and leadership within the project. SPDK has seen increased
interest in orchestration, especially the SPDK CSI Kubernetes plugin, so we are pleased
to announce that Yibo Cai and Antti Kervinen are joining the core maintainer team
with a specific focus on the spdk-csi project. Yibo and Antti will be responsible
for helping define and refine the architecture and design for spdk-csi, as well as
being primary reviewers for all incoming patches.

As primary contributors to spdk-csi to date, both maintainers will bring the
necessary technical leadership and direction to SPDK as it is integrated into
Kubernetes and cloud computing infrastructure generally. We are all excited to have them!

Thanks,

Ben Walker (representing the core maintainer team)
