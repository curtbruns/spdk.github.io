## What is PMDK?

[PMDK](https://pmem.io/pmdk) an open-source project hosted by Intel.
The introduction of Persistent Memory (PMEM) marks the beginning of
a revolution in the computing industry. PMDK is a collection
of open-source (vendor-neutral) libraries that makes this new paradigm of
merging Memory and Storage possible.
[Optane Persistent Memory](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/optane-dc-persistent-memory.html)
blurs the line between storage and memory by being both byte-addressable as well as persistent

## What is Intel® Performance Analyzers?

Intel provides a set of performance analysis tools for developers to design,
optimize and debug applications for maximizing performance across Intel CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs.
[Intel® VTune™ Profiler](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/vtune-profiler.html#gs.03tz94)
collects key profiling data needed to optimize application performance, system performance,
and system configuration for HPC, cloud, IoT, media, storage, and more.
It also supports SPDK, PMDK, and the latest Intel® Optane™ DC persistent memory.
[Intel® Advisor](https://targetmailer.intel.com/TMService/Redir.aspx?ID=4882783)
is a design and analysis tool for achieving high application performance.
This is done through efficient threading, vectorization, and memory use,
and GPU offload on current and future Intel® hardware.
[Intel® Inspector](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/inspector.html#gs.0hekj6)
helps locate and debug threading, memory, and persistent memory errors early
in the design cycle to avoid costly errors later.
Customers also get early access to our latest hardware via the
[Intel® DevCloud](https://targetmailer.intel.com/TMService/Redir.aspx?ID=4882785),
a free, virtual development sandbox to learn about and program one API cross-architecture applications.
